    More than double the amount of women are taking care of themselves plus one other person.

    In a January 2025 study by the Mayo Clinic, researchers found that women 45-60 years old who are managing family caregiving and menopause face nearly double the risk of moderate to severe menopause symptoms.

    Dr. Ekta Kapoor, a co-investigator of the study, says women providing 15 or more hours of care per week are especially affected, with half of them experiencing moderate or worse symptoms.

    It is estimated that up to 1 in 3 women may face misdiagnoses regarding menopause and its associated symptoms, often requiring between two and five medical appointments before a correct diagnosis is made.

    Despite women constituting 51% of the population, there remains a significant gap in research and data on how medical symptoms impact women differently from men. This disparity may explain why, of the 500 women surveyed, Higgs LLP documented over 90 symptoms inadequately diagnosed by healthcare professionals.

    1 in 4 women reported being wrongfully prescribed pain medication in an attempt to manage their symptoms without addressing the underlying cause. Following closely behind, 1 in 5 women found themselves prescribed antidepressants or SSRIs as doctors overlooked the root cause of their condition.
