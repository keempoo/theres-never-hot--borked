    It is estimated that up to 1 in 3 women may face misdiagnoses regarding menopause and its associated symptoms, often requiring between two and five medical appointments before a correct diagnosis is made.

    Despite women constituting 51% of the population, there remains a significant gap in research and data on how medical symptoms impact women differently from men. This disparity may explain why, of the 500 women surveyed, Higgs LLP documented over 90 symptoms inadequately diagnosed by healthcare professionals.

    1 in 4 women reported being wrongfully prescribed pain medication in an attempt to manage their symptoms without addressing the underlying cause. Following closely behind, 1 in 5 women found themselves prescribed antidepressants or SSRIs as doctors overlooked the root cause of their condition.
